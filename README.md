# bats-vscode-devcontainer

A template for developing [BATS (Bash Automated Testing System)](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) with VS Code in a Devcontainer. Since [Hacken](https://hacken.ca) mostly uses Bitbucket Pipelines, that is supported as well as GitHub Actions.

Provides a development environment with:
- BATS 1.11.0-1
- [Task](https://taskfile.dev)


## Usage:
`bats **/*.bats`, or
`task`
